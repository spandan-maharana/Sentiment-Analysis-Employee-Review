# Sentiment-Analysis-Employee-Review
Text Sentiment Analysis using NLP and facilitated through BERT model.
Text Sentiment Analysis (SA) has become an increasingly popular method for organizations to understand the perceptions and opinions of their employees. It is the study of opinions, sentiments, attitudes, emotions, mood of a conveyor expressed in written language. SA involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the emotional tone expressed in text. This can be used to determine the sentiment of employee feedback, which can be used to identify areas that require improvement or to highlight successful practices. The aim of this project is to present a detailed analysis of the sentiments of a review for the employee provided by their peers and managers using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, a language model that has proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, machine translation, etc. With the help of BERT we aim to identify the sentiment expressed in employee reviews and understand the factors contributing to the positive or negative sentiments. The dataset used in this study consists of the employee reviews from various industries and organizations which comprises both negative and positive reviews. The first step in this project is to perform data pre-processing on the dataset and to remove any redundant data points. This entails cleaning the data, removing stop words and punctuation, and converting the text to a numerical format that the BERT model can process. Following that, the dataset will be divided into three parts: training, validation, test. The goal is to fine-tune the pretrained BERT model on the training set using a binary classification task to predict whether a review is positive or negative, and then to evaluate the model on the validation and test datasets to determine performance. The study's conclusions are expected to have a wide range of effects on organisations. The analysis can primarily be used to pinpoint the aspects of the working environment that need to be improved. It can then be utilised to pinpoint productive procedures in the workplace. Last but not least, the model can offer information that might be useful in identifying the elements that contribute to employee retention and satisfaction across all organisational departments. In summary, this study shows how well the BERT model does sentiment analysis on employee reviews. The programme was able to correctly categorise the tone used in employee reviews and pinpoint crucial factors that can influence whether a review is positive or negative.
